#Project Overview
As part of Theory of Algorithms module we have been asked to re-create a very popular Countdown Numbers Game in Racket Functional programming language. Countdown first aired on British Channel 4 in 1982. </br>
During the number part of the game the contestants had to combine 6 randomly selected numbers to get as close as possible to a randomly generated total. </br>
Note that the contestants were using just the 4: **+ - / x** arithmetic operators.
